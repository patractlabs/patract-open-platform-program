## Project Introduction

Plasm Network is a DApps hub on Polkadot that supports Ethereum and layer 2 solutions like ZK Rollups. Plasm aims to be a multi-chain smart contract platform that will support multiple blockchains and virtual machines like EVM and Wasm.

## Wasm contract technical support

Since Plasm Network is a WASM based smart contracts platform on Polkadot, we are integrating Patract's tools such as Redspot, Ask!, and Metis. All latest information is available in our documentation: https://docs.plasmnet.io/

## Developer activity

Once Plasm is live, we will enable DApps Staking. This feature allows developers to deploy WASM smart contracts and earn PLM tokens as a basic income. 

Currently, you can deploy WASM contracts on Plasm Network testnet. Here is the tutorial: https://docs.plasmnet.io/build/smart-contracts/wasm
