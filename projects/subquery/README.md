# [SubQuery](https://subquery.network/)

## Project Introduction

SubQuery’s mission is to make the world’s decentralised data more accessible. We are a data-as-a-service provider that aggregates and organises data from Polkadot and Substrate projects, serving up well-structured data for developers to use for a wide array of projects.

Indexing and transforming data is fundamentally what SubQuery does. We allow people to create a SubQuery Project, which is a set of instructions on how the Indexers should traverse the blockchain, what data to collect, and how it should be shown to users. Anyone can use our SDK tools to create their own Project, and then use SubQuery Projects to upload it to our managed service so we can run it for you, for free.

## Wasm Contract Technical Support

SubQuery joins Patract Open Platform as a data infrastructure provider that complements the need of Polkadot’s ecosystem for decentralized data, by liberalizing access, and reducing the operating costs of connecting and applying data in the project.

## Developer activity

SubQuery is exploring solutions to combining SQL and data indexing tools with Wasm smart contracts.
