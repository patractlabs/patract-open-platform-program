# [SubDAO](https://www.subdao.network/)

## Project Introduction

SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO’s cross-chain management, but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

Through SubDAO’s Web2.0 middleware, users can implement DAO governance directly on traditional social platforms. Developers can quickly integrate DAO governance in their blockchain, web pages, iOS/Android mobile devices and PC applications through the SubDAOO Airfone SDK. In addition, SubDAO’s series of templates and ecosystem tools allow DAO to implement various decentralized application scenarios such as crypto assets management, credit lending, and instant messaging.
