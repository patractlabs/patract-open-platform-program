## Project Introduction

Zenlink is committed to building a new generation cross-chain DEX network. 

By integrating the Zenlink DEX Module, Zenlink can enable parachains to quickly access DEX capabilities and share liquidity with other parachains; Zenlink DEX aggregator can link all DEX DApps on Polkadot. 

Users can not only complete the exchange easily and quickly but also enjoy a low slippage transaction experience. 

ZLK, Zenlink native token, provides a fair and transparent governance mechanism and reasonable value capture methods, which can be used to motivate ecosystem users to participate in network development for a long time.

## Wasm contract technical support

ZenLink Dex Smart Contract(Wasm Contract) was supported by Web3 Grant Programs. Zenlink has completed v0.1 in December 2020 and delivered successfully.

The Zenlink DEX Protocol has been updated to the V0.3 version, and its Module implementation was complete. As a result, Zenlink will update the Smart Contract version next. The new version will support assets cross-chain transfer and swap and be compatible with the latest Statemint asset standards.
