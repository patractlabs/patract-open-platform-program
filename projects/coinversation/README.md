## Project Introduction

Coinversation Protocol is the first synthetic asset issuance protocol and decentralised contract trading exchange based on the Polkadot contract chain. It uses the token CTO issued by Coinversation Protocol and Polkadot(DOT) as collateral, and synthesizes any cryptocurrencies or stocks, bonds, gold and any other off-chain assets through smart contracts and oracles. The assets minted by all the users correspond to the liabilities of the entire system, and the proportion of each userâ€™s liabilities has been determined at the time of forging, so that their respective profits can be calculated. Because such a collateral pool model does not require a counterparty, it perfectly solves the problems of liquidity and transaction depth in decentralised exchange(DEX).
