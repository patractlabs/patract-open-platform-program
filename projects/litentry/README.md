## Project Introduction

Litentry is a cross-chance Decentralized Identity (DID) Aggregator that enables the linking of user identities among multiple decentralized networks. Built on the Substrate framework and featuring a DID indexing protocol, Litentry provides a decentralized, verifiable identity aggregation service that removes the redundancy of code and the hassles involved in resolving agnostic DID mechanisms. Litentryâ€™s DID Aggregator is compatible with all DID standards, and powered by a reliable DID data interface. Everyone can build and submit DID methods to Litentry, making identity data easily accessible in the Web3.0.
